Defined a state variable which is an array of 2, both initialized with 3. When x takes a turn. array[0] is decremented, and array[1] for o. This tracks when we get to 3 moves. Added if statement that checks if remaining moves are at 0. Created new variable, piecetomove, initialized to -1. Added else if to handleclick that says if there are no moves, and piecetomove is at -1, then set the value of piecetomove to i and wait for next click. Created new data structure, with keys for positions for 0-8. Values correspond to possible valid moves. Added else statement that checks if the move is valid using data structure. If it is, then it sets nextsquares to the corresponding values and changes XIsNext. Resets setpiece to -1. Added if statement for pre 3 move case that detects if squares at position are already written in. If so, move is invalid so returns early. Added if statement in if else statement that checks if box is occupied by piece owned by player. If not, then returns early. In else statement, added if statement that checks box is unoccupied. If not, return early. Added if statement that checks if player has middle square and that the piece they are moving is not this middle square. If so, make a temp change to nextsquares that checks if the move will result in a win. If it doesn't, undo changes, return early and setpiece to -1 as the move is invalid. Added console logs to display place in code for debugging purposes. Expanded upon exisitng changes of status to communicate to player whos turn it is. Npm dry-pack results were as expected, with no errors or warnings
