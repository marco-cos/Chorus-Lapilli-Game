Began by installing node.js on my computer. Opened the start code in codesandbox, downloaded the zip file, and unzipped and opened the directory in vscode. Ran npm intsall and npm start. Opened localhost:3000. Copy and pasted squares to make multiple. Put them in divs with the board-row class to seperate them. Created a square function with the code for the button, and replaced the duplicated buttons with <Square />. Added a value argument to square, changed the text of square to value, and added corresponding vlaues for the quares on the board. Added handeclick function that is called onlick. Imported usestate, added it to square so it can remember being clicked.. Removed the value from the calls of squares in the board. Set value to X when clicked. Made a squares array that stores the value, changed square function to display the value passed in. Added a new onSquareclick prop to square, that is called onclick. Added handeclick function, which has argument i which is the square clicked. It makes a new array and changes the square value to X and passed it into setSquares. Added X is next state, which will allow for adding Os. Changed handclick, adding if/else statement that sets X or O depending on if X is next. Inverts X is next after. Fixed bug that you can click on square multiple times, by checking if there is value and returning early if so. Added calculatewinner funciton, which checks the board status to see if someone has won. Made handleclick return early if someone won. Added winner status, which takes returned winner from calculatewinner and displays it on board. If no one has won, displays next player
